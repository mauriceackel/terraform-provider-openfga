# openfga_authorization_model (Resource)

Provides the ability to create and manage OpenFGA authorization models.

An authorization model defines one or more type definitions and optionally a set of conditions.

Together with relationship tuples, the authorization model determines whether a relationship exists between a user and an object.

~> **NOTE:** We suggest using [`openfga_authorization_model_document`](/docs/data-sources/authorization_model_document.html) when assigning a value to `model_json`. This allows to use models in different formats (e.g. DSL, JSON, Terraform native) and prevents potential complications arising from formatting discrepancies, whitespace inconsistencies, and other nuances inherent to JSON.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "openfga_store" "example" {
  name = "example_store_name"
}

data "openfga_authorization_model_document" "example" {
  dsl = <<EOT
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type document
  relations
    define viewer: [user]
  EOT
}

resource "openfga_authorization_model" "example" {
  store_id = openfga_store.example.id

  model_json = data.openfga_authorization_model_document.example.result
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `model_json` (String) The authorization model definition in JSON format. Consider using [`openfga_authorization_model_document`](/docs/data-sources/authorization_model_document.html) to set this field.
- `store_id` (String) The unique ID of the store this authorization model belongs to.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique ID of the authorization model.

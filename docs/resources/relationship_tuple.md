# openfga_relationship_tuple (Resource)

Provides the ability to create and manage OpenFGA relationship tuples.

A relationship tuple consists of a user, a relation, and an object. Tuples may include an additional condition, which has to be fulfilled for the tuple to be considered.

Together with an authorization model, the relationship tuples determine whether a relationship exists between a user and an object.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "openfga_store" "example" {
  name = "example_store_name"
}

data "openfga_authorization_model_document" "example" {
  dsl = <<EOT
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type document
  relations
    define viewer: [user]
  EOT
}

resource "openfga_authorization_model" "example" {
  store_id = openfga_store.example.id

  model_json = data.openfga_authorization_model_document.example.result
}

resource "openfga_relationship_tuple" "example" {
  store_id               = openfga_authorization_model.example.store_id
  authorization_model_id = openfga_authorization_model.example.id

  user     = "user:user-1"
  relation = "viewer"
  object   = "document:document-1"
}
```
